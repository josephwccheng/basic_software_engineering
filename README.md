# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to learn about the basics of Software Engineering, split into different Topics. For each topic, I'd like to discover how to use and implement them in Python3 and where applicable, calculate the space and time complexity.

Note: Some topics might be more applicable in other languages but I have chosen python3 as the implementation language.
